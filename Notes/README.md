# Data sheets

There is few tutorial with detailed introduction to the hardware specification of the MCUs and sensors. 

Sometimes rebuilding the tutorial project can be very easy and fast by simply copy the hardware connection and the code, but it's not the same when creating something of your own if not understanding the mechanism behind it.
